        if error
          set is double equal to false
        else if cell value is not positive
          set is double equal to false
      
        
    if is double (all the cells for the amount of money contain double inputs and they are all positive)
      open a new file and overwrite it

      else
        return true (is a valid integer)
  else if checking if double
    try converting to double
    if error
      return false (not a double value)
    else
      return true (is a valid double)
  else
    return false (error in programming)
